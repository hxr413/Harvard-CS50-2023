- I'm completely new to Python, so it's a bit confusing to switch from C syntax to Python syntax.

- Had a little problem with the requirement "rejects a height of 9, and then accepts a height of 2", but managed to solve it with recursion. I think the application of recursion here is pretty cool, and this makes me get to understand the merits (or say beauty?) about Python a little bit.
