Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The predictions generated when N = 10 and 100 vary to a relatively great extent, hence inaccurate.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think starting from N = 10000, the predictions are good enough.
When N = 1000, the winning chance varies within a range of a few percentages.
When N = 10000, the range is about 1%.
When N = 100000, the range is smaller than 0.5%.
When N = 1000000, the range is about 0.1%.
I think a varying range of 1% will suffice for predictions.
