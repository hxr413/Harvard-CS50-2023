- I didn't change anything in `styles.css`, but just uploaded it so that if anyone opens `index.html`, it will look good.
- Thanks to @727021#9153 from CS50 Discord server for telling me about using `preventDefault` to stop the page from reloading when submitting the form.

- I only uploaded code here but no image folder. The full website's repository is [here](https://github.com/hxr413/CS50-PSet8-Homepage).
- I think it will take a lot of extra time, work and effort to produce a legit website meeting the requirement, since the lecture only scratches the surface of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I need to learn much much more than what the lecture taught in my own time. Though ChatGBT helped a lot in this process, I still have a lot to learn and do myself, which is exhausting and frustrating. 
- But I still think web development is pretty interesting, and hopefully I can make a much better website for my final project, for which I'll have more time to study these languages to achieve the effect I want.
