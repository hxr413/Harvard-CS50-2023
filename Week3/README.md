- Pretty much just repeating what's done in `scrabble.c`, but building the entire programme from scratch. Quite fulfilling that I wrote and debugged (using `printf`) everything myself, without looking at any other people's code. 
- A side note: for the `int count_letter(string t)` function, `isalnum` and `isalpha` also work fine as this question doesn't take too many practical details into account.
