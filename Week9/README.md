### [Lab 9: Birthdays](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/9/)

- This one basically just uses what's taught in the lecture, so it's not difficult, but helpful in getting familiar with the teaching content.
- I found details that could be improved after watching the solution, but to keep the code as it is originally written, I chose not to make modifications. 


### [Problem Set 9 Description](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/8/)
See folder `finance`.

- I uploaded the whole folder, but my work mainly centres on `app.py`, `buy.html`, `history.html`, `index.html`, `quote.html`, `quoted.html`, `register.html`, `sell.html` and `style.css`. For the html code, I referred to the [staffâ€™s solution](https://finance.cs50.net/login).
- It is a huge project, so I divided the work into 3 days. It's difficult at first, but gets much better as I become familar with the principles. Agian much thanks to the CS50 Discord server, which helps me solve errors about implementation details. 
- For the personal touch part, I add a form to `index.html` which allows users to add or subtract cash from their account. And their addition/subtraction will be shown on `history.html` as buying and selling.
- This is the last problem set of CS50, and is indeed a massive one. Before Week 9, I was feeling low for a long while and interrupted my study of CS50, but I managed to pick it up, and I'm very happy and satisfied to complete all the challenges - proud of myself! For the final project, I plan to learn more about coding and then come back - will finish it this year!
