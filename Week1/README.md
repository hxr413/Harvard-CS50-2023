### [Problem Set 1 Description](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/1/)

### My Assignment Work
`hello.c`  
`mario_less.c`: When input is not an integer, line 10 doesn't print, since the boolean expression in line 13 only considers the situation when input is a wrong integer. Tried to add more conditions and take more datatypes into account but failed. My current knowledge (02/13/2023) is not sufficient to solve this.
