### My Assignment Work
`hello.c`  
`mario_less.c`: For those who are less comfortable with computer science  
- When input is not an integer, line 10 doesn't print, since the boolean expression in line 13 only considers the situation when input is a wrong integer. Tried to add more conditions to take more datatypes into account but failed - it seems like my current knowledge (02/13/2023) is not sufficient to solve this.   

`mario_more.c`: For those who are more comfortable with computer science  
- Can be easily done once worked out `mario_less.c` - just added a new line of printing two spaces and then copied one of the for loops.   

`cash.c`: For those who are less comfortable with computer science  
`credit.c`: For those who are more comfortable with computer science
