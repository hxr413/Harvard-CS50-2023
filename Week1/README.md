### [Lab 1: Population Growth](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/1/)

### My Assignment Work
`population.c`: The standard answer  
`population2.c`: A failed attempt trying to use a for loop 
- It was my first instince to use a for loop, so I tried to make it work after finishing `population.c`. Well, it seems like a for loop turned out not to be the best solution.    

### [Problem Set 1 Description](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/1/)

### My Assignment Work
`hello.c`  
`mario_less.c`: For those who are less comfortable with computer science  
- When input is not an integer, line 10 doesn't print, since the boolean expression in line 13 only considers the situation when input is a wrong integer. Tried to add more conditions to take more datatypes into account but failed - my current knowledge (02/13/2023) is probably not sufficient to solve this.   

`mario_more.c`: For those who are more comfortable with computer science  
- Can be easily done once worked out `mario_less.c` - just added a new line of printing two spaces and then copied one of the for loops.   

`cash.c`: For those who are less comfortable with computer science  
`credit.c`: For those who are more comfortable with computer science
