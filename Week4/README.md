- The `blur` function is pretty painful. I initially wrote very long code with lots of unnecessary variables etc., so first of all there were lots of grammar/syntax mistakes. After deleting all the unnecessary bits and tidying things up, my code still didn't work. It was not convenient to use `debug50` so I basically just stared at my code and tried to modify anything that I can think of and might go wrong...Till now I am still not sure what went wrong exactly but only have guesses based on `check50`, as once it gave some positive feedback, I knew I got something right. I probably spent 4+ hrs on this and 3/4 of the time on `blur`. Fortunately it worked out eventually... and I'm burned out...
- One thing I'm proud of is that I insisted my own thinking (in terms of which functions to use and how they can work to get the desired results) throughout the coding process, and I kind of developed all the improvements and modifications myself. That's probably also part of the debugging... 
- Referred to [this document](https://github.com/mancuoj/CS50x/blob/master/Week4/1-filter-less.c) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoHIX_PNGcE) during my exhausting debugging. Many thanks.
